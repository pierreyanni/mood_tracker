🌀 Mood Tracker (Work-In-Progress)

Tiny project, big feelings.
This is an early experiment to track moods, habits, and whatever else future-me decides is useful.

Everything here is tentative, messy, and likely to change tomorrow.
Expect shifting ideas, unfinished features, and the occasional existential commit.

Stay tuned — or don’t. The project isn’t sure yet either.
